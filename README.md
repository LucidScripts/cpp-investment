This is a simple C++ script that calculates investment amounts with adjustable initial investments, term lengths, and interest percentages. Also includes an option for monthly deposits.

This script was made to be modular, so updates can be made and the script can be improved upon without much digging, and nearly everything is commented. The displayReport function is a bit wordy and messy, this could be improved upon by making the cout with the balance and interest format its own function.

One of the most difficult aspects of this project was deciding how to structure the code base, and what should be included inside of the InvestmentData class and what should be kept outside of it. As well as this, the nested loop to calculate the investment with monthly deposits were a bit tricky at first.

I feel there are many aspects of this project that will be transferable to other projects, in particular, the experience with input validation and nested loops I could see coming in handy in the future.

To keep the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I kept all of the code very modular, and well documented with comments.
